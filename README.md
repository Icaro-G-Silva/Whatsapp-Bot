# Whatsapp-Bot
> Whatsapp Bot is a simple bot that send a message to anyone on your contacts list with some extra functionalities

# How does it work?
By manipulating the browser with the specific driver for it, we are able to control all DOM and URLs. So we managed to enter Whatsapp via the Whatsapp Web application URL and from there everything is 100% automatic.
Basically this is how it works

# The Driver
The driver used was the chrome browser in version 81. However, you **need** to check your browser and install the driver for it in the correct version it is in.

# Dependencies
The only package I used that needs to be installed if it isn't in your python, is **Selenium**.

To install it just type the following command: 
`pip install selenium`

# Functionalities
  + Send a custom message to someone
  + Send the message to more than one contact
  + Set a specific time to send the message
  + One joke of this bot was the implementation of the "flood" feature.

# Comments
The path in the DOM used, may change; then it is always good to check in your browser.

# Version
> 1.0
